* Final Year Project
*The purpose of this project is to investigate the Human-Robot interaction. We make a game from UNITY and acts as medium of interaction. We also investigate the Social Praise as as Social cue use by the robot itself. We design the 2D Unity game that focused on survival in an island. There are 10 tasks, each task has 10 different choices to choose from. The participant need to choose 1 choice then the robot will persuade or advice the participant to choose other choice iclide with some facts. It's up to the particiapnt itself wheter he or she want to follow the robot advice or not. In this game, there is no right or wrong answer. If the participant follow the robot advice, the robot will give praise ( social ) toward the participant. From there, we also investigate stress from the participant by using the Groove Gravial Skin Response sensor (GSR sensor). Thsi GSR sensor can detect as small slight in skin conductivity or resistence. Through there we can see wether the participant is stress or not throught the game play.
